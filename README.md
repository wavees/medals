## About
What is this, anyway? The idea for this mini-service came to me absolutely spontaneously. So, it's a service where users give themselves some certain titles, and other users either agree with one or another title, or disagree. It's also planned to make a small game out of it. You can learn about this game when we start making it at all. Well, that's kind of the whole idea... Oh, yeah! We also want to try to integrate with some popular social media networks, and we think that'll be cool! We'll at least try.

## Contributing
And yeah, you can frely contribute to this project! I dunno what should I say here... It'll be very helpful? Definelety, yes! Now that's all I wanted to say
